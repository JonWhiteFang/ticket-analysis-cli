# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural decisions made during the development of the Ticket Analysis CLI. ADRs help maintain a historical record of why certain design choices were made and provide context for future development decisions.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

1. **Title**: Brief description of the decision
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context**: Background information and problem statement
4. **Decision**: The architectural decision made
5. **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes of the decision
6. **Implementation Notes**: Technical details and considerations
7. **Date**: When the decision was made
8. **Participants**: Who was involved in the decision

## ADR Index

### Core Architecture
- [ADR-001: Use Clean Architecture Pattern](ADR-001-clean-architecture.md)
- [ADR-002: Adopt MCP for Data Access](ADR-002-mcp-integration.md)
- [ADR-003: Implement Strategy Pattern for Analysis](ADR-003-strategy-pattern-analysis.md)

### Security and Data Handling
- [ADR-004: Data Sanitization Strategy](ADR-004-data-sanitization.md)
- [ADR-005: Authentication via Midway](ADR-005-midway-authentication.md)

### Technology Choices
- [ADR-006: Python 3.7 Compatibility](ADR-006-python37-compatibility.md)
- [ADR-007: Click Framework for CLI](ADR-007-click-framework.md)

### Testing and Quality
- [ADR-008: Testing Strategy and Coverage](ADR-008-testing-strategy.md)

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Copy the [ADR template](ADR-template.md)
2. Number it sequentially (ADR-XXX)
3. Fill in all sections thoroughly
4. Get review from team members
5. Update this index when accepted

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR (reference the new ADR)

## Guidelines for ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Affect the overall architecture or design
- Have long-term implications
- Are difficult to reverse
- Impact multiple components or teams
- Involve trade-offs between alternatives

### Writing Good ADRs

- **Be concise but complete**: Include all necessary context without being verbose
- **Explain the "why"**: Focus on reasoning behind the decision
- **Consider alternatives**: Document options that were considered but rejected
- **Be honest about trade-offs**: Include both positive and negative consequences
- **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon and make it accessible to future readers

### Maintaining ADRs

- Update status when decisions change
- Reference related ADRs
- Keep implementation notes current
- Archive outdated decisions appropriately
