# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ticket Analysis CLI Application is a Python-based command-line tool designed to analyze Amazon's internal ticketing system (t.corp.amazon.com). The application will generate comprehensive metrics, trends, and HTML reports with visualizations to help teams understand their ticket patterns and performance. The system integrates with Amazon's Builder MCP (Model Context Protocol) for secure data retrieval and provides both CLI and HTML reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to authenticate securely with Amazon's internal systems, so that I can access ticket data without compromising security credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL authenticate via subprocess calls to `mwinit`
2. WHEN authentication is performed THEN the system SHALL never log, print, or store credentials
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL validate authentication before proceeding
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to retrieve ticket data from Amazon's ticketing system, so that I can analyze team performance and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL integrate with Amazon's Builder MCP using TicketingReadActions
2. WHEN querying tickets THEN the system SHALL support full Lucene query syntax
3. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter
4. WHEN empty datasets are returned THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without errors
5. WHEN malformed responses are received THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing
6. WHEN data retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want to analyze ticket metrics and trends, so that I can make data-driven decisions about team performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing data THEN the system SHALL use pandas DataFrames for data manipulation
2. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL support configurable date ranges with a default of 30 days
3. WHEN processing ticket data THEN the system SHALL calculate key performance indicators and trends
4. WHEN encountering edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics and insights

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate reports in multiple formats, so that I can share insights with different audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating CLI reports THEN the system SHALL display data in tabular format with color coding
2. WHEN creating HTML reports THEN the system SHALL use Jinja2 templates with embedded CSS/JS
3. WHEN including visualizations THEN the system SHALL embed matplotlib charts as base64 in HTML
4. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators using tqdm
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL save them to a configurable output directory (default: ./reports/)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a command-line user, I want an intuitive CLI interface, so that I can easily configure and run ticket analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL be built with the Click framework
2. WHEN specifying options THEN the system SHALL support argument groups for Time Period, Output Options, Configuration, and Authentication
3. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+C THEN the system SHALL handle interruption gracefully with proper cleanup
4. WHEN displaying output THEN the system SHALL use color coding (red=errors, green=success, blue=info)
5. WHEN help is requested THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration options, so that I can customize the application for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support a configuration hierarchy: command-line arguments, configuration files, environment variables, default values
2. WHEN configuration files are used THEN the system SHALL support both JSON and INI formats
3. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
4. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to handle sensitive data securely, so that ticket information and credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL only use subprocess calls to `mwinit`
2. WHEN processing ticket data THEN the system SHALL sanitize all data in logs and outputs
3. WHEN validating input THEN the system SHALL validate all input data before processing
4. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use secure temporary files
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can maintain and extend the application with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use the pytest framework
2. WHEN testing external dependencies THEN the system SHALL mock all external dependencies
3. WHEN testing scenarios THEN the system SHALL test both success and failure scenarios
4. WHEN measuring coverage THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum 80% code coverage for core modules
5. WHEN testing CLI commands THEN the system SHALL include integration tests

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want the application to follow modern Python standards, so that it's maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining data models THEN the system SHALL use @dataclass with complete type hints
2. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use custom exceptions defined in models.py
3. WHEN implementing modules THEN the system SHALL implement interfaces from interfaces.py
4. WHEN designing components THEN the system SHALL follow dependency injection pattern for testability
5. WHEN structuring code THEN the system SHALL follow single responsibility principle
6. WHEN targeting compatibility THEN the system SHALL support Python 3.7 and use `python3` command throughout

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to integrate seamlessly with Amazon's internal tooling, so that I can access comprehensive ticket and task data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring MCP THEN the system SHALL configure Builder MCP server for Amazon internal tooling
2. WHEN retrieving tickets THEN the system SHALL implement TicketingReadActions for ticket search and retrieval
3. WHEN accessing tasks THEN the system SHALL support TaskeiGetTask and TaskeiListTasks for task management
4. WHEN searching documentation THEN the system SHALL include InternalSearch for documentation lookup
5. WHEN MCP calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic
